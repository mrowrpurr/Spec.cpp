_Almost_ ready for release ðŸŽ‰


## TODO

- [ ] Write Specs for Specs ðŸ‘“
- [ ] Rename `GlobalSpecGroup` (_it's more than groups now_) and make it (and `GlobalInterface`) nice for external consumption from DSL-makers
  - [ ] Extract the concept of data for 'next' component or spec into a structure
- [ ] Parameterized tests
- [ ] Parallel test runner
- [ ] If possible, add support/adapter for `BOOST_TEST`
- [ ] If possible, add support/adapter for GoogleTest's `EXPECT_THAT` and/or `ASSERT_THAT`
- [ ] If possible, add support/adapter for Catch2 assertions
- [ ] CLI options to include/exclude by:
  - [ ] tag (text or regex)
  - [ ] test name (text or regex)
  - [ ] group name (text or regex)
  - [ ] full test name with groups (text or regex)
  - [ ] file name (text or regex) **if possible**
- [ ] CLI option to glob for `.dll/.so/.dylib` files
- [ ] Provide example of programmatically providing those ^ filters, but from a custom entry point
  - _e.g. How I will likely want to do for my Skyrim test runner_
- [ ] **Maybe** provide a `Given`, `When`, `Then` syntax
- [ ] Bundle up the syntax options into simpler `#include`'s
  - [ ] A bit simpler to BYO syntax selection
  - [ ] Provide RSpec-ish `BeforeEach`/`It`
- [ ] Finish docs :)

# What?  <!-- omit in toc -->

C++ test framework with simple syntax which supports async tests.

```cpp
#define SPEC_GROUP My_Tests

#include <Specs.h>

Setup { /* Setup Code */ }
Teardown { /* Teardown Code */ }

Test("Some thing") {
    assert_that(69 == 420);
    AssertThat(69, Equals(420));
}

TestAsync("Slow thing") {
    // Do something slow...
    done();
}
```
