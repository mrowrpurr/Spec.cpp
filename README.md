# What?  <!-- omit in toc -->

C++ test framework with simple syntax which supports async tests.

```cpp
#define SPEC_GROUP My_Tests

#include <Specs.h>

Setup { /* Setup Code */ }
Teardown { /* Teardown Code */ }

Test("Some thing") {
    assert_that(69 == 420);
    AssertThat(69, Equals(420));
}

TestAsync("Slow thing") {
    // Do something slow...
    done();
}
```
